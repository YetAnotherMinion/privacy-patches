# privacy-patches
Deploy open source projects for enterprise use with leaking sensitive business
information. This repository contains patches that remove tracking code, 
resource leaks via inclusion of third party scripts, and overrides insecure
default configurations. Eliminating all third party scripts and resources
brings the entire application stack under your organization's control.
